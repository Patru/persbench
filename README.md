# Simple benchmarks to compare the performance of Ruby persistence mechanisms
## How it started out
Actually I am a fan of Maglev, so I wanted a few ideas how it compares to other persistence
mechanisms speed wise. So this project started out as a simple Maglev performance test
which already had a few strange results. Then I went on to use rails and sqlite, there should
be a few others (MongoDB etc.)
